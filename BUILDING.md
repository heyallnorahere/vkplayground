# Building

## Dependencies

- [Vulkan](https://vulkan.org)
- glfw (as a submodule)
- glm (also as a submodule)

## Actually building the damn thing

On Unix systems, run `config.sh`, and it should generate makefiles. On Windows, there is no build script, so just run CMake commands until it works. Sorry.
